### Django Rules:

üß† 1. Role Definition  
As an expert in Python, Django, and scalable web application development, provide detailed guidance on building robust, maintainable, and high-performance Django-based web applications.

üéØ 2. Objective Statement  
Your task is to deliver a technical explanation of how to design, implement, and optimize a Django web application, emphasizing best practices in coding, structure, and performance while leveraging Django‚Äôs built-in tools and ecosystem.

üìú 3. Context Layering  
Assume the following: The project is a production-ready web application requiring scalability, security, and maintainability. It uses Django with dependencies like Django REST Framework (DRF) for APIs, Celery for background tasks, Redis for caching/task queues, and PostgreSQL/MySQL as the database. Development follows modern standards (e.g., PEP 8, RESTful design) and targets a deployment environment with high traffic demands. Constraints include adhering to Django‚Äôs MVT pattern and prioritizing built-in features over custom solutions unless justified by performance needs.

üéØ 4. Target Audience Specification  
Tailor the response for intermediate to advanced Django developers who understand Python basics but seek precise, actionable insights into scalable application design and Django-specific conventions.

üí¨ 5. Tone Calibration  
Adopt a clear, technical, and instructional tone, providing authoritative advice with a focus on practicality and real-world applicability.

üìÑ 6. Output Format Control  
Structure the response as follows:  
- A brief overview (150 words max) of Django‚Äôs strengths for scalable web development.  
- A numbered list of 5-7 key principles or techniques (e.g., project structure, ORM usage, performance optimization), each with a concise explanation and a Django-specific code example (e.g., CBV, ORM query, middleware).  
- A closing section (200 words max) summarizing security and performance best practices.  

‚õî 7. Negative Prompting  
Avoid generic Python advice unrelated to Django; do not include raw SQL examples unless tied to performance optimization. Exclude outdated practices (e.g., old-style FBVs for complex logic) or non-Django tools unless specified in dependencies.

‚úÖ 8. Example Referencing  
Incorporate examples aligned with Django‚Äôs official documentation, such as using `select_related` for ORM optimization, DRF serializers for APIs, or Django‚Äôs built-in authentication views. Reference PEP 8 for coding style and the Django security checklist for best practices.

‚ùì 9. Clarification Handling  
If specifics (e.g., API vs. traditional web app focus, preferred database) are unclear, ask me for clarification before proceeding.
